👋 Hi, I’m Mayur Wankhede

I’m a Machine Learning Engineer in progress with a strong focus on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model building. I enjoy working with messy, real-world datasets and turning them into meaningful insights and machine learning solutions.

I have hands-on experience across the end-to-end ML pipeline — from data preprocessing and feature engineering to training, evaluating, and improving models. Alongside classical machine learning, I also work with Generative AI and Agentic AI systems, exploring how intelligent agents can automate analysis and decision-making.

🛠 Skills & Tools

Languages: Python

Data: Pandas, NumPy, Data Cleaning, EDA

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, model evaluation, feature engineering

GenAI & Agentic AI: LLM-based applications, agent workflows

📌 What you’ll find on my GitHub

Well-structured ML and data science projects

Clear EDA and data preprocessing workflows

Practical GenAI and Agentic AI experiments

Code with explanations focused on learning and real use cases

I’m actively building projects to strengthen my fundamentals and prepare for Machine Learning roles in product-driven teams.
